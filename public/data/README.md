# Source of Data

Most map layers come from Open Street Map, according to a somewhat complex procedure documented [here](https://github.com/brendannee/bikesy-server).

Winter bike map trails came from two sources:

- One geojson file came by email from Kira Smith at TRPA to Nick Speal at LTBC. It has since been modified in response to requests.
- Another comes from Town Of Truckee:
  - https://data-townoftruckee.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/trails/data
  - Download as Shape File
  - Covert to GeoJSON: https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/
  - Paste into truckeeTrails.geojson
