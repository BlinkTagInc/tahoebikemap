# Bikesy

This is a web app used to display bike routes provided by the [Bikesy Server](https://github.com/brendannee/bikesy-server)

It allows users to specify a start and end point to a route along with a hill tolerance (from avoiding hills to not weighting them much at all).  It uses the mapbox API to display the routes provided by the Bikesy Backend and allows drag and drop start/end points.

### Bikesy API

You can pull info directly from the bikesy backend using the [Bikesy API](https://blog.bikesy.com/api/: https://blog.bikesy.com/api/)


The assumptions that go into the routes provided by the Bikesy API are documented on the [Bikesy API page](https://blog.bikesy.com/api/) .

### Example
