Bikesy Frontend
=========

Bikesy Frontend is HTML, CSS and Javascript used to display bike routes provided by the [Bikesy Backend] https://github.com/brendannee/Bikesy-Backend

The Bikesy frontend allows users to specify a start and end point to a route along with a hill tolerance (from avoiding hills to not weighting them much at all).  It uses Google Maps API to display the routes provided by the Bikesy Backend and allows drag and drop start/end points.

### Bikesy API

You can pull info directly from the bikesy backend using the [Bikesy API]https://blog.bikesy.com/api/: https://blog.bikesy.com/api/


The assumptions that go into the routes provided by the Bikesy API are documented on the [Bikesy API page]https://blog.bikesy.com/api/ .
